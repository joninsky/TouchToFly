# TouchToFly
Touch to fly is a solution to keeping flight training organized and increase visibility of the student’s progress. 

The FAA has a document called the Private Pilot Practical Test Standards. The document outlines the structure for the test that the student is training to take and is a very under utilized tool in developing a flight training curriculum. 

This app provides a drill down solution to keep track of the high-level topics and details needed to study tasks. There are free document the FAA provides in the form of PDF’s that contain all the material and then some needed to study for these tasks. I have cut these documents up and assigned the exact pages containing the content for each task to that page. At its core the app provides the information the student needs to study when they need it and provides progress and tracking of total progress.
